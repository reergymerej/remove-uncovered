Q. How do I delete uncovered code from my source automatically?
  Q. How do I identify uncovered code?
    A. pytest-cov reporter xml

    I. We can see teh filename and lines (numbers and hits).  We know which
    lines in which files were not hit.

    If we delete from the bottom up (or just prepend with `#`), we can "erase"
    all these.

    Q. Is there a parser for pytest coverage xml?
